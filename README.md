# BookSwap -  A project using MERN stack
BookSwap is an online platform that seeks to connect book lovers for fast and
easy exchange of pre-loved books. The online platform is designed with robust
security measures from user registration, log-in, and account management. Book
Swap users can smoothly list books they wish to swap or lend giving details on
the author’s name, the title’s name, the genre, and the condition of the book. To
ease traceability, users can browse for books based on the author’s name, the title
and the genre of the book, and its location for easy pick up when lending. The
platform also facilitates user behavior with the request system, allowing users to
send and receive requests for specific books.
